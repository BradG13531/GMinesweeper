Graphical Minesweeper

This project is a graphical version of my terminal based Minesweeper project: https://github.com/BradG13531/Minesweeper

I used Unity to create the game and Aseprite to create all of the sprites.

The goal of Minesweeper is to reveal all of the cells without revealing any bombs. The cells with numbers indicate how many bombs are in the surrounding 8 cells. An empty cell means there are no bombs surrounding that cell. The player can place a flag on a cell to indicate that they believe a bomb exists on that cell.

Controls:
- Left mouse click
  - Reveal a hidden cell
- Right mouse click
  - Place a flag on a hidden cell
- Middle mouse click
  - If the correct number of flags are placed around a revealed cell, middle mouse click the cell to reveal all neighboring cells
- Escape
  - Open pause menu
- q
  - Quit Game
